# VSB-React-Portfolio
Using React to create an updated portfolio of my work.
My task was to create a portfolio using my new React skills, which will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies. 
## Live App
https://vbproglobyte.github.io/React-Portfolio/

## Tech

    - GitHub pages
    - React
    - npm

## Installation
    
    -- npm i
    -- npm i gh-pages

## Usage - and prep
### Add Homepage to package.json

First we need to open the `package.json` file for the client and add an entry called `homepage`. The value of `homepage` should have `{username}` as your GitHub username, and `{repo-name}` as the name of the GitHub repository you created: 

```
https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}
```

Your updated `package.json` should look something like this:

```text
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
```

### Install gh-pages and Add Deploy Scripts

To publish your app, you need to install the `gh-pages` npm package. Additionally, you'll need to add a few more scripts to `package.json`. Start by simply adding the `gh-pages` dependency:

```sh
npm i gh-pages
```
**Note:** You will see another package manager called `yarn` suggested by `create-react-app`. `yarn` is very similar to `npm`, but for the sake of consistency we will stick with `npm`.

Now lets add the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts to `package.json`. 

```text
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
```

### Launch with React
    - Predeploy [ npm run predeploy ]
    - Deploy [ npm run deploy ]
### Launch Locally
    - npm start
